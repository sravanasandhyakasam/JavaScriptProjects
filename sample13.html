<!-- When an event happens, the browser creates an event object, puts details into it and passes it as an argument to the handler.
Here’s an example of getting mouse coordinates from the event object
Some properties of event object:
event.type
Event type, here it’s "click".
event.currentTarget
Element that handled the event. That’s exactly the same as this, unless you bind this to something else, and then event.currentTarget becomes useful.
event.clientX / event.clientY
Window-relative coordinates of the cursor, for mouse events.-->

    elem.onclick = function (event) {
        // show event type, element and coordinates of the click
        alert(event.type +" at "+ event.currentTarget);
        alert("Cordinates:::::" + event.clientX +":"+ event.clientY);
