<!-- Object handlers: handleEvent
We can assign an object as an event handler using addEventListener. When an event occurs, its handleEvent method is called with it
when addEventListener receives an object as the handler, it calls object.handleEvent(event) in case of an event.
We could also use a class for that-->
<html>
<body>
<button id="elem">Click Me!</button>
<script>
    class Menu{
        handleEvent(event){
            switch(event.type)
            {
                case 'mousedown':
                    elem.innerHTML = "mouse button pressed...";
                    break;
                case 'mouseup':
                    elem.innerHTML = "mouse released...";
                    break;
            }
        }

    }
//The menu object only gets mousedown and mouseup here, not any other types of events.
    let menu= new Menu();
    elem.addEventListener('mousedown',menu);
    elem.addEventListener('mouseup',menu)
</script>
</body>
</html>
